# Overview

File: climate_analysis.ipynb

Use weather data "Hawaii.sqlite" to analyse and  understand the ideal time for surfing and ice cream season and plotting the percipitation rate for each month for 2016 and 2017. Get the number of station from where the percipitation data was collected for the analysis and which all station among them were the most active station and have recorded most of the data. Have also taken the record of the temperature ranges in the most active station. Analysing the data for the full year. Tools used for this analysis were python, sqlalchemy in jupyter notebook 

Plot for percipitation vs Months from 2016 and 2017

Use weather data "Hawaii.sqlite" to analyse and  understand the ideal time for surfing and ice cream season created a dataframe with the columns of date and temperatures for the month of June and December

# Results

By analysising the data for the temperatures for the month of June and December we can see that has significant difference with maximum temperature 85
in June  and 83 in December and minimun temperature being 65 in June and  56 in December

Statistical Analysis for June



Data from the stations for the month of June is more than the month of June with the average temperature being 74.94  and the average temperature being 71
